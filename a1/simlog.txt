Running 500 simulations using 2 linecooks and 1 assemblers.

Q1: Which areas of work lead to bottlenecks?
- An avg. order waits 0.00 seconds to be prepared
- An avg. order waits 441.60 seconds to be assembled
--> The primary bottleneck is the Assembly Station (burgermaster).

Q2: How long does the average lunch break last at counter 3?
The average time to clear all orders is 3.62 hours (13039.06 seconds).

Q3: How much idle time do the linecooks and the Burgermaster have on average?
- Linecooks (Prep): 91.63% idle time.
- Burgermaster (Assembly): 17.17% idle time.

Q4: How long do students wait on average for their burgers?
Students wait on average 4.62 minutes (277.20 seconds).

The average burger takes 34.62 minutes (2077.20 seconds) to process from receiving the order to finish packaging.
